              <p>
                Your first visit may include allergy skin testing. In that case, please allow 
                approximately one hour for the test and visit. After the skin test our doctor 
                will discuss the results with you. Wear comfortable clothing. You will be asked to take your top off, so please do not wear a one-piece outfit.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Important:</strong> There are allergy medications which need to be discontinued prior to the allergy skin testing. This is very important for the accuracy of your test. <a href="/allergy-skin-testing">Please review carefully here:</a></p>

              <h3>Insurance & Referrals</h3>
              <p>
                If you have an insurance plan that requires any referrals, pre-certifications or 
                authorizations to receive any specialty care and diagnostic testing it is your 
                responsibility to obtain such a referral or authorization from your primary care 
                provider or your insurance company prior to your visit at PAAC. If you choose to be 
                treated without a referral you understand you will be held responsible for all charges 
                for the services rendered. If you arrive without a referral and choose to reschedule 
                your appointment, we reserve the right to charge you a late cancellation fee.

                We are aware that emergencies arise, and plans change. However, we ask for at least 
                24 hours advance notice for a cancellation since it affects both our staff and other patients. 
                If an appointment is missed or cancelled with less than 24 hours notification, you will be 
                charged missed appointment fee.
